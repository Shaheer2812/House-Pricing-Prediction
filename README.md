# House Price Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Model  

This project develops a **machine learning model** using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on key real estate features. The model is trained on structured housing data, with preprocessing and feature engineering steps to improve accuracy.  

## Features  
- **Predicts House Prices**: Uses key real estate attributes to estimate property value.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends in house pricing.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Improves model performance through data transformations.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (Visualization)
